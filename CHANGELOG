0.06	28 December 2003
	Added automatic required modules update using Devel::Required.

0.05	13 August 2003
	Cleaned up Makefile.PL and updated copyright info.  Made sure the
	test-suite runs with strict and warnings enabled.

	Fixed problem with test for already defined-ness of a sub-module:
	they really won't be created again if they already exist.

0.04	11 July 2002
	Upgraded test-suite to make it ready for Perl core inclusion (if that
	ever happens).  Added check for PerlIO and EBCDIC also, by courtesy of
	Jarkko Hietaniemi.

	Rearranged top of source to not need fully qualified VERSION anymore.

	Checked for defined() problems: fixed one in "import".

0.03	10 July 2002
	Migrated to the PerlIO::via:: namespace.

0.02	9 July 2002
	Fixed some documentation nits reported by Rafael Garcia-Suarez.  Added
	some more explanation as to why the eval module approach was taken.

	Version number now a '' string (oops).

	Added check so that module is not re-evalled if already available.
	Adapted t/04basic.t to sort of check this.

0.01    8 July 2002
	First version.
